          There is another developer out in the world named Michael Abdullah.  He owns a blog at <a href="http://mikeabdullah.net/">mikeabullah.net</a> and has some Github commits under the same name.  Fortunately, he appears to work mostly on IOS and Cocoa development, while I focus more on Enterprise Architecture and Web Development, and new Product Development.
          <br /><br />
          If you're looking for IOS development, I recommend checking him out; us Michael Abdullah's have to stick together, right!
